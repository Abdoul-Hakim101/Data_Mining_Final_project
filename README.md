# Data Mining Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the Data Mining course at Nisantasi University's Department of Software Engineering. The project focuses on predicting renewable energy (solar power) potential in various countries using data mining techniques.

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the potential for solar power energy production in different regions. By analyzing various factors and attributes, such as solar radiation, wind speed, geographical features, and demographic data, the project aims to inform energy planning and policy-making.
